The ENVRI School 2022, "Road to a FAIR ENVRI-Hub: Designing and Developing Data Services for End Users", will take place in Lecce, Italy from 10 to 15 of July 2022.

This is a unique opportunity for the ENVRI-FAIR partners and ENVRI Community RIs to receive face-to-face training from the experts on the design and development of data services with a particular focus on end-user issues.

The school topics include service documentation, service tutorials and support, service validation and evaluation, reusability and interoperability of services, etc. Useful examples from the ENVRI-FAIR tasks and the ENVRI-Hub will be also discussed during the school.
